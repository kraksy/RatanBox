# world

## base world and its people in ideas

- I may set story for few planets , so the game universe is little more bigger than expected but I rather keep it to one planet , one place where the game happens 
- so because there is long time skip , that means I can make the planet earth like sandy , if the game will happen on the earth 
	- or maybe the planet earth after the human race left , can be like full of exotic forests , and new organisms and animals, and also some invasive from space or something like that
- in terms of new species I can add few new , but that depends if I want to make the game on earth mainly 
- phobias n racism could be kept from real life , but also can be changed to be more cruel or more forgiving 
	- I can keep it as real life , but also should make humans extremely racist against alien life forms , and also against robot life forms
	- or make humans more submissive and keep them as like sub life form under all things , that is more of like work force 
-  technology could be same shit , but like after finding better better materials technology like computers , or factory machine could me exponentially better in terms of performance 
	- I could work on more materials that will replace lot of earth materials in terms of performance 
	- and push the limits of real life technology so it make sense to the world 
	- I want to keep it as the humans still have work done by hand so it still feels human like
		- but then I can make the others more ahead , even the robot race I want to have there could be more advanced and have all the work done by "themselves" anyways but they wouldn't put like chips that will make them think so the work robots would be "dumb"

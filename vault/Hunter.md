# Hunter

## Character building

- maybe I will make the character female for the joke
- but I will not any age , because she will be non-Human 
- lost memory ? v v  quite stereotypical for this type of character ^1a0a5f
	- but with that I can implement that any Ability that character will acquire , but Hunter has it from start she was manufactured . . she just gets the access the moment she unlocked it
- I don't want to make her instantly killer that is capable of killing anything
	- maybe roll with the lost memory idea , and just she will start with the worst skills , like Kenshi-like bad state , so player can level up the character
	- or maybe just she will be broken on the start of the game , and player need to collect scraps or advanced parts to fix hunter ^85daf7
- I could make her like that she has her own mind , and the player is just "just pilot" that controls her body  ^d86ca0
	- and that can make a lot of interactions between player and the character , also can be somehow funny 
- the robot race will be something prehistorical something that old civilization **forgot** here 
## Character Design

- Mainly I don't want her to be like hunter from risk of rain , so I will carefully look at some pics on Pinterest So there will be no problems with that
- also when drawing the design I really should make few states , like broken and after some fixes and upgrades , and design that could be used for end game or fully fixed state ( and that maybe can be first design that will be drawn , and then just broke it more and more till I get something for the start )

- I don't think I want to make her somehow human , she will be 100% *robot* 
- and also I should make characteristics for the *robots* , and also I should give them a name
	- like few "models" or parts that I can mash up together to make another robots  ^3f6fbb
	- and also focus on like robots specializations so it looks different

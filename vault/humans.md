# humans

## humans in my world 

- I could make humans not base for living organism in the universe , like its lot on side 
	- like robots in the universe are more dominant or any alien species , well that would make sense in real life , but in terms of my universe , it could be really like group 
-  or maybe I can make them near extinction , no planets where they can live, or just small squishy bodies , so they are weaker to another species
- maybe it could be funny that monkeys , one moment in time just said , that they will evolve to like next gen monkeys , so they can be as intelligent at least near human
	- and also I can implement another earth animals to be more intelligent in the "future"

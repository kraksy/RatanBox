# Hunter naming system

## rules to name a hunter 

- should implement few letter in the name, I could make that the first letter is for the job that hunter is assigned when created 
	- farmer hunters name would start with letter A ( Agriculture ) first letter in alphabet, so its really important in terms of surviving in space
		- A ( as I mentioned , Agriculture )
		- W ( assistant ) 
		- M ( military staff )
		- S ( military soldier )
		- G ( gastro "food" )
		- 
	- date of creation should be there 
	- id , so how many of them were created , and whats its id 
		- I may split it up and make it that the number of them created will be in the end
	- another letter could be grade of the hunter 
		- D ( development grade ) // unfinished hunter just for testing
		- C ( civilian grade )
		- M ( military grade ) etc 
- [[Hunter#^3f6fbb]] how should I name a cyborg that is mash up together ?
	- I could just scrap the name , the do the same thing . . mash up .. but also that will make the name longer , or maybe there could be system to make it shorter

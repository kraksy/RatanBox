# Hunters

## Hunters as a race , as civilization

- [[Hunter#^1a0a5f]] I could make it that the whole civilization lost memory from some time where they were prosperous  , and now they are just walking husk robot bodies
	- and the memory was caused by a event that erased the memory of hunters , I will call it the dawn , for this moment  . . and as I progress more in the story I could call it better name 
- [[Hunter#^d86ca0]] also this would be nice if I put some historical context behind it or just logical , I could make it that the humans made hunters as units that can be controlled by the humans, but when humans are there to control them , they can move how they want , and do whatever , but like they will still be forced to work what are they supposed to do

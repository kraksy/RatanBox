## `ratanbox` 
- openGL
- sokol header files 
- win32 / windows window
- x11 / linux window
- my own header files

## `my own usage`
I have few plans with this toolbox like 
- 4d rogue-like sci-fi 
- `will add later` 

## `building project`

```
    make main
```
- will build game file im working on , Im coding this project while working on game , so I will perfectly know what to code next
<br>
```
    make win32
```
- will build a windows window
<br>
```
    make linux
```
- will build a window for linux

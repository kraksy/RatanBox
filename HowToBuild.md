# building with batch files through cmd 

- Open cmd ( no need admin )
- Write `shell` into the cmd // it will open enviroment
- Then if you wan to build just write `build`
- And if you want to directly compile and run , just type `devenv` and locate build dir to open main.exe

:: For now keep it as main.exe , maybe later change it to something else.

# changing batch files to your liking
